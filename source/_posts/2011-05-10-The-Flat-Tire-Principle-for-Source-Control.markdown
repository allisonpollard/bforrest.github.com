title: The Flat Tire Principle for Source Control

[The Flat Tire Principle for Source Control](href="http://lostechies.com/erichexter/2009/05/19/the-flat-tire-principal-for-source-control/")

Here&#8217;s an oldie but a a goody by [Eric Hexter](href="http://lostechies.com/erichexter/") on why you should source control your dependencies and 3rd party libraries. He uses an automobile which carries all the tools required to replace a flat tire to illustrate how we should treat our source control systems. Anything that code depends on to do it&#8217;s job should be stored in the same version control system right along side of the code.
