[Why Johnny can’t build a decent user interface.](http://jeffreyellis.org/blog/?p=8897")An interesting read by [Jeffrey Ellis](http://thethinkerblog.com/?page_id=5) that I picked up from a <a title="@shanselman" target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/#!/shanselman">@shanselman</a> tweet. It is a reminder of why I write software -&gt; for end users to get something done. There&#8217;s a list of questions that I need to keep top of mind when developing applications:

+Who are the users

+What are their goals

+What are their tasks

+What information do the users need in order to accomplish those tasks

The information within the comments is also enlightening.
