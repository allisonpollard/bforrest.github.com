I spent some time over the weekend dragging along old posts from my tumblr blog that deal with programming. I didn't bother with the instagram pictures or the four square checkins. After a few failed attempts to get the tumblr posts where the were suposed to be, I opted to stash them in a working directory and move them by hand.

Now all of my `<scarcasm>`glorious code related posts`</sarcasm>` are in one place, it's time to dust up some posts about my shiny new play things [Twitter Bootstrasp](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/") [Octopress](octopress.org") and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax"). Stand by for more intesting things in the very near future.
