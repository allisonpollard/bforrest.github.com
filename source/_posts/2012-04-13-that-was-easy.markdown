Taking the Octopress plunge
-------------

Last night I took the plunge and set up [octopress](http://octopress.org/) to host a [blog on github](http://bforrest.github.com) using github pages. The documentation on octopress.org is impeccable. My only hic-up was not fully understanding that I need to run 
{% codeblock [rake tasks] %}
rake generate
rake deploy
{% endcodeblock %} after committing and pushing from my source branch.

Now to have some fun learning [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and how to style this so that it doesn't look like everyone else's octopress blog
