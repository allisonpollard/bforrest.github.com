[Treetrim:](http://code.google.com/p/treetrim/)

I&#8217;ve used this spiffy utility many times. Every time I see a need for it, I&#8217;m working on a PC that doesn&#8217;t have it installed and I can never remember the magic incantation that allowed Google to reveal it to me. So, since I&#8217;m starting to suffer from old-timers, I&#8217;ll keep a handy link for it right here ;-)</p>
