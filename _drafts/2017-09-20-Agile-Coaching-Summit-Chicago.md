After meeting some wonderful agilists at the [Agile Indy 2017](http://agileindy.org/conference/) and making my podcast debut on [Agile For Humans](https://ryanripley.com/afh-069-dynamic-teams-with-allison-pollard-and-barry-forrest/) I started following the other presentors and paying more attention to the agile coaching space. I certainly won't claim the mantle of agile coach - too many folks have invested countless hours honing those skills for me to attempt to userp that role name; However, I think I'm becoming a talentd 'nudger' and I'm having fun learning about the soft skills that I've neglected for far too long.



Decided to head to an agile coach camp open space in Chicago [#ACSChicago](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23acschicago&src=typd)
