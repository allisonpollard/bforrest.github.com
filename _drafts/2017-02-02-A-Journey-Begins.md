What happens when an [agile CTI coach](http://allisonpollard.com) gets bored and knows someone that they believe has something to contribute to the agile software community? Basically a double-dog dare and the offer of a helping hand to help you find your voice and start sharing your experience and point of view with others.

Some time has passed and the memory has faded, so forgive me if I don't get this exactly right in the telling of the story. It began with a simple question: How'd you like to co-present a talk titled "Brewing Great Agile Team Dynamics". The [AgileIndy 2017](http://agileindy.org/conference/) conference was the week before an open wheel car race weekend at "The Brickyard". I've been in the audience plenty of times when Allison has co-presented and I suspected that she wouldn't let me look like a complete fool.
