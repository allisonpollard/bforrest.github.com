What happens when an agile [CTI coach](http://allisonpollard.com) gets bored and knows someone that they believe has something to contribute to the agile software community? You basically get a double-dog dare to do a conference talk and offered a helping hand to find your voice and start sharing your experience and point of view with others.

Some time has passed and the memory has faded, so forgive me if I don't get this exactly right in the telling of the story. It began with a simple question: How'd you like to co-present a talk about *"Bitter Beer Face Communications"*. The [AgileIndy 2017](http://agileindy.org/conference/) conference was the week before an open-wheel car race weekend at "The Brickyard". I've been in the audience plenty of times when Allison has co-presented and I suspected that she wouldn't let me look like a complete fool.

Admittedly, I half-assed an abstract and talk description: *Why “Agile Transformation” gives teams “Bitter Beer Face”: How to combat FUD.* and presented it to Allison for comment. It wasn't quite up to her expectations, she was thinking of targeting a different/wider audience than my abstract might attract. So, I polished a bit and got it reviewed again. At that point, I had brushed it off and was ready to let the entire thing slide.

Fast forward a few weeks and another email from the conference organizers -"...your proposal "Brewing Great Agile Team Dynamics – No More Bitter Beer Face Communications... has been selected." - through the strength of Allison having presented the previous year, our talk had been selected. Awe, hell, what have I gotten myself into? Time to really work on a talk. I've never done more than five minutes in front of an audience. Now what am I going to do? The freakout was in full force.

Luckily Allison is well passed the freak out and knows what she's doing. We iterate on a time line for the talk, settle on the exercise that we're going to use for audience participation and start hashing out the points that we want to cover. A real-life conference talk is born.

Between mid-March and the conference in June, I took care of important things. I scouted seats and purchased tickets for the Indy Car race weekend. I booked the hotel and the airline tickets. And I worried about the impending doom, I mean talk.

There was lots of worrying. Accompanied by lots of reading from the various DISC practitioners and trying to synthesize my own explanation so that I wouldn't sound like a monotone robot. I also read up on a variety of team activities to learn about the DISC model and tried to incorporate that into my understanding and fluency.

By the morning of the talk, Allison and I had met several times to run through the talk. I'd crammed all things DISC and I was much more relaxed and calm than I ever would have imagined. When we got to the room to do final prep, there was only one snag - there was only one microphone and it had left the room with the previous speaker.

The last time I had to project my voice was on a parade ground more years ago than I'm willing to admit. Allison said that I sounded pitiful (or some such) and I really need a mic to be heard in the back of the room. I was rescued within minutes as the previous speaker reformed their clepto ways and brought the mic back.

Most of the talk was a blur. I didn't feint. There were no vurps. My voice only cracked once that I'll admit to publicly. Each of the attendees seemed to have a lovely time with the workshop activity (except for the ONE person who hates group activities, but showed up anyway).
